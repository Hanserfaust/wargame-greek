    <description>Subtitled &amp;quot;wargame rules for a civil disturbance in a mythical modern big city&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Excerpts from the rulebook:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;These rules are designed to simulate the events and actions of a major public disturbance of the type seen during the post-war years in the Western world. The concept has been inspired (if such is the word) by the continual media coverage of such regrettable events throughout the world.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Fundamental to this game is a sort of 'Theory of Riots; which is that a riot is one, violent, expression of deep-rooted unrest by members of the civil population. The causes of riots are not the subject of these rules, merely the events following their start.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It is intended for use with 25mm or OO/HO scale models, with a crowd of 150 or so figures and 40-50 police/security forces; there is no reason why the game should not be played using 1/300 scale models, or even 1/32! (provided of course that the other scales are changed as appropriate).&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The preferred way of playing the game is with one or more umpires and a group of say, 4-6 players (but there are other ways of setting up the game - see later).The players all represent the Security Forces and are given a copy of the SF Rules.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In practice, depending on umpire experience, we have found you need one umpire for every 3-4 players - there is quite a lot to do.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;This game can also be played quite successfully as a solo game. To be most successful played solo it needs plenty of time to work through all the actions.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This set of rules was originally released in 1983. A revised edition was released in 2001.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
