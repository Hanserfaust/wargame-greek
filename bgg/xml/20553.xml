    <description>This is a Stratego-like game that's actually two games, an army game and a navy game.  Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
