    <description>Seven scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader.  Most involve Australian troops and are small scenarios suitable for tournament play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios included are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BC1: SHORT SHARP SHOCK, SYRIA, June 8, 1941: In support of the Australian 7th Division, British commandos land behind the main Vichy line of resistance. Their objective, a bridge along the main axis of advance. But first the men of No. 11 Commando will have to silence a menacing battery of Vichy howitzers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BC3: 42ND STREET CRETE, May 27, 1941: German mountain troops stream over the rocky hillsides pursuing what they think is a beaten enemy. But as they approach a major Allied supply dump, they bump into a fighting patrol from the Australian 2/7th Battalion. The Aussies launch a bayonet charge which could be their last of the war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BC4: TIN CANS TIN HATS, SYRIA, July 8, 1941: A Vichy tank sitting on a bridge is holding up the Allied advance. The Australians send a company of infantry to evict the unwanted vehicle but the R35 has friends and won&amp;rsquo;t go quietly.&amp;#10; BC5: STORMING THE AMPHITHEATRE, BOUGAINVILLE, February 6, 1945: The whistle of shells and the dull thud of smoke rounds alert the Japanese defenders on their fortified ridge line. Before long the Australians emerge from the shroud and into a wall of withering fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BC6: WALKABOUT, BOUGAINVILLE, March 30, 1945: A rumble of tank tracks and the sight of the lurching armoured monsters sends panic through the Japanese ranks sitting in their muddy foxholes, but their leaders steady their charges and order them to fire at the supporting infantry now coming into view.&amp;#10; BC7: BRIGADE HILL, NEW GUINEA, September 8, 1942: The Australians defending along the Kokoda Track face an unprecedented disaster. Somehow the Japanese have enveloped an entire brigade and cut the line of communication to headquarters. It&amp;rsquo;s time for the Aussies to break-out or perish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
