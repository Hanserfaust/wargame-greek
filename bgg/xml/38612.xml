    <description>&amp;ldquo;In the second century BC the rich trading empire of Carthage vied with the rising Roman Republic for control of the Mediterranean. In the Second Punic War Carthage's legendary general, Hannibal, surprised the Romans by crossing the Alps and invading their homeland. His army was too tough for the Romans to defeat on the field of battle, but not tough enough to capture Rome. Finally the Romans sent a young and ambitious general named Scipio to invade Carthage. The ploy worked, and Hannibal was summoned home to defend the city.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;The decisive battle was fought in Zama, in Northern Africa. The battle featured contrasting armies: the citizen soldiers of the Roman Legions against the mercenary army of Carthage. The two sides were closely matched. The Carthaginian army included close to one hundred poorly trained war elephants. The tuskers were mostly ineffective against the well-prepared Romans.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10; A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.
