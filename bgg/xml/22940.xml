    <description>from Europa Simulazioni website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;All is lost save Honour&amp;rdquo; is a game about the campaigns fought during the Italian Wars (1494-1530), mainly between the Hapsburgs (the Empire) and the Valois (the French kingdom). The first volume is devoted to campaigns between Agnadello (1509) and Pavia (1525)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All began after reading Taylor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Art of War in Italy 1494-1529&amp;rdquo;, London, 1920. Soon that period looked extremely interesting to us and nearly neglected by the wargame community.&amp;#10;Our intent was to generate any interest, among &amp;ldquo;aficionados&amp;rdquo; and historians, about that ancient era, when the first applications of modern strategy in the art of war took place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the time of charges of cavalrymen with the finest gliding armors; of the first use of fire arms and artillery (with some effect); sieges, mercenary troops, treachery, pillaging and all that &amp;ldquo;chrome&amp;rdquo; that may enlighten a wargame.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those campaigns were led to bring to &amp;ldquo;the battle&amp;rdquo;, which was often decisive, we decided to bring in a detailed sequence of the main battle (said &amp;ldquo;Major Battle&amp;rdquo;). So in the game, there are three kinds of battle: Major Battle, Skirmish and Siege with the Major Battle involving different tactics played by each side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map represents Lombardy in the XVIth century and the neighbors states. The sources for the maps were new books and old manuscripts and maps, among which a manuscript dated 1520 (!), regarding the state of the roads in the area between Lodi and Piacenza.&amp;#10;Many books have been written about this subject and I think we have read the most important ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We had to make a selection of all those campaigns fought in Italy during the Italian Wars. The five campaigns we have included are:&amp;#10;- Agnadello 1509, Venice defends its Republic against the foes. &amp;#10;- Novara 1513, the Swiss against the French army. The last triumph of the Swiss.&amp;#10;- Marignano 1515, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois I grabs the Duchy of Milan from the Swiss&amp;#10;- Bicocca 1522, the French lose the Duchy of Milan&amp;#10;- Pavia 1525, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois I loses the largest battle and Milan to the Empire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Highlights:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     new game system, operational-level, devoted to warfare in the XVIth century campaigns&amp;#10;     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on maneuver and careful planning&amp;#10;     various forms of combat: Major Battles, Skirmishes, Sieges&amp;#10;     set of Exclusive Rules and specific rules and events for each campaign&amp;#10;     a 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; fine-art map , reproducing a part of XVIth northern Italy, based on an accurate study of ancient maps and sources&amp;#10;     gorgeous iconic counters representing all the main Capitani who fought there and the different combat units&amp;#10;     detailed (as it is possible) order of battle, with combat units differentiated by strength, maximum movement, quality and reliability&amp;#10;     very low counter density and limited play time&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
