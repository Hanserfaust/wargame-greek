    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Cannon Ball"/>
    <description>One of 9 games released by Helen Of Toy Game Company that graced many a comic book from the late 50's into the early 80's. Cannon Ball is a classic Comic Book War Game with a Civil War theme. The Comic Book Ad claims the game was dedicated to the &amp;quot;Fighting Heroes&amp;quot; of the Battle of Chickamauga,where &amp;quot;34,400 troops were killed or wounded.&amp;quot;   Cannon Ball seems to have included 64 3D Toy Soldiers representing Blue &amp;amp; Grey Civil War Troops; as well as a Playmat and multiple Accessories such as &amp;quot;Exploding Bridges&amp;quot; (these were small hard plastic pieces which were triggered by rubber band tension, similar to the Tank Trap War Game's &amp;quot;Exploding Tanks.&amp;quot;) The Troops of Cannon Ball were evidently made by GIANT in Hong Kong. However, it has also been suggested that some versions of the Game featured generic/non-brand-name Troops clearly made with the same GIANT molds but not stamped with the GIANT logo. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
