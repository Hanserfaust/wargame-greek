    <description>Plan West&amp;trade;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- While Poland mobilizes and the diplomats try to find a peaceful solution to the Danzig situation, Hitler launches a back-stabbing attack without a formal declaration of war. Although England and France support Poland and on September the 3rd declare war on Germany, the Poles are left to fight alone&amp;hellip;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game components:&amp;#10;- Book-case box&amp;#10;- 70 x 50 cm map (28 x 20 in)&amp;#10;- 264 die-cut counters &amp;#10;- Game rules &amp;#10;- 1 die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the late 1930s, Polish generals Berbecki, Bortnowski, Kasprzycki, Kutrzeba and R&amp;oacute;mmel designed Plan West (Plan Zach&amp;oacute;d) for the defence against a German invasion. The planners had predicted the direction of most of the German thrusts, with the exception of the intensity of the flanking movement via Prussia and Slovakia. Although the Polish Army had already started their mobilization during mid-August, the final part was postponed until August the 30th due to the political situation and the work to find a diplomatic solution. However, on the German side, a general mobilization had already been completed under the cover of a military exercise, and the German army was deployed around the Polish border according to the German strategic invasion plan, Case White (Fall Wei&amp;szlig;), originally developed by generals Blumentritt and von Manstein. &amp;#10; Plan West&amp;trade; is an attempt to create a fun and fast-paced board game on one of the most decisive campaigns during World War II. The game is based around a chit-pull system and a Victory Point time track that forces the Germans to operate at a historical tempo during the game. Plan West&amp;trade; covers the first 10 days of the campaign and is played on a coffee table sized map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
