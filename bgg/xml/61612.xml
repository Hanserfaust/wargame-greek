    <description>Death or Glory - What&amp;rsquo;s it all about?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These rules are one of the first historical projects to come out of Spartan Games. The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
