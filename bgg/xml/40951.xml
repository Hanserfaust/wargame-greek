    <description>Guerilla - Universal Rules for Warfare by Iain Dickie, Rules by Jim Webster&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Webster seems to have authored the rules for actual combat, while Dickie apparently authored the rules for determining the forces and deployment.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Simple miniatures rules for guerrilla warfare in a wide range of eras.  (A list of guerrilla wars going back to Scythians vs Persians in 516 B.C. is included.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The forces for each side (State and Guerrilla) are determined randomly.  A d6 and a d100 is rolled for each side.  The d6 determines how many officers(state) or leaders(guerrillas) are present; the d100 result is the number of troops.  The two rolls together determine the force's mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For example, a roll of 3/13 gives the state forces one major, two captains, 3 lieutenants and 13 troops.   Their mission reads, &amp;quot;You have captured one important guerrilla leader and must escort him, alive, from one corner of the table to the opposite for a show trial. Convoy.&amp;quot;  A roll of 6/50 gives the guerrilla forces 6 leaders (and, as a 6 was rolled, one of them must be secretly designated the chief leader of the war) and 50 troops.  Their mission reads, &amp;quot;Funeral of a fighter, now a martyr, being used to whip up support.  The three most senior leaders are at the graveside with both parents of the victim.  Next the enthusiastic fighters form a ring, surrounded by the reliable and unreliable fighters mixed, who are in turn surrounded by the fanatics and remaining leaders. Company.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The way in which troops are deployed on the board is determined by cross-indexing the mission type of each side on a table.  In the above example, the state's mission type is &amp;quot;convoy&amp;quot; and the guerrillas' is &amp;quot;company,&amp;quot; which gives &amp;quot;deploy company first then start convoy.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A d10 is rolled to determine the location, which can range from &amp;quot;Steep hill country&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dense woodland&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;city back streets&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;market town, market day, very crowded.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
