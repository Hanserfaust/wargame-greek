    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="By Jove That Will Do! The Battle of Salamanca (1812 AD)"/>
    <description>&amp;quot;The battle of Salamanca in Spain was a part of the Peninsular Campaign which lasted from 1808-1814. It was as a result of Napoleon invading Spain and putting his brother on the throne of Spain. It also resulted in a British general in winning fame and glory. Wellington would begin his winning streak in Spain.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Salamanca was the most decisive battle of the entire war which smashed Marshal Marmont`s French army. Although the war would continue for two more years, the French were put on the defensive, as the British, Portuguese and Spanish troops harassed the French until they were pushed back over the Pyrenees mountains into France.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students. The game is designed to be played on a 1.5x1 meter table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures mounted two per base (except for commanders and cannons). Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The streamlined &amp;quot;fast play&amp;quot; rules encompass unit formations, charges, commanders, and morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
