    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Britain Stands Alone (Second Edition)"/>
    <description>This game was announced awhile back and we are working together with the designer to bring it back in full printed edition.  There is not set time for this project to be completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Britain Stands Alone 2nd Edition simulates one of the greatest &amp;quot;what ifs&amp;quot; of all of history, the German invasion of Great Britain.  Historically, the RAF won the Battle, and Adolf Hitler called off the invasion, sending his forces east in a fateful decision to attack the Soviet Union in 1941. In Britain Stands Alone, players are under no compulsion to repeat this, and instead the decisive campaign of World War II will take place on the shores of the United Kingdom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since the map covers all of England, and not just the historically-planned invasion beaches around Dover, the players have enormous freedom to explore other possibilities. Would East Anglia be a better landing site than Kent? Or the West Country? Maybe the Germans would want to make a direct attempt to seize the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth? All of these possibilities, and many more, are within the scope of Britain Stands Alone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, Britain Stands Alone comes with a wealth of further variants. The Germans might have enhanced naval forces, such as the famed battleship Bismarck joining the Kriegsmarine a year early, or the Germans might have lost fewer torpedo boats and destroyers in the previous campaign for Norway.  Maybe instead of using nothing but jerry rigged river and canal boats for landing craft, Germany manages to develop purpose-built boats similar to the LCT's employed by the Allies in World War II.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the British side, there are variants for greater Free French involvement, including by elements of the French navy, more arms from the Americans, and more tanks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original edition of Britain Stands Alone, published by GMT Games, remains popular, yet is now out of print.  The Lock 'n Load Publishing edition will not be a straight reprint, but a major upgrade of a title already held in high regard.  Players can look forward to incorporation of all errata to date, fresh development, additional validation of all systems, and even more variants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course too, Britain Stands Alone will have updated graphics that gamers have come to expect from Lock 'n Load Publishing. Designed by Jim Werbaneth, three-time Charles S. Roberts Award winner, Britain Stands Alone offers a very playable operational treatment of one of the most important campaigns that never happened.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
