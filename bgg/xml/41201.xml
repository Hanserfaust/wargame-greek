    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Turning Point: Fleet Action 2 Master Rules"/>
    <description>From the back of the book:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It seemed like only a few hours since the ENS Horan had backed out of the docking arm at Saturn Base. In truth, it has been several days, each intervening day filled with frantic activity as the crew prepared for the forthcoming battle. Now that battle was upon them. On the plot, two fleets could be seen closing in on one another. As the captain of the Horan watched, flanking forces detached themselves first from the European fleet, quickly followed by matching elements from the Union fleet. These elements would attempt to get around the heavy screens to the key units the escorts were protecting, the flagship and carriers. Soon the battle would truly be joined...&amp;#10;__________________________________________________________&amp;#10;What you hold in your hands is the Master Rules to the Fleet Action 2 combat system as well as the introductory information to the epic Turning Point Universe. These rules will allow you to fight massive battles involving potentially dozens of ships and even more fighters. If that's not enough, a highly robust and flexible design system will allow you to create the fleet of your dreams, whether it be from your favourite sci-fi epic or concocted from the deepest realms of your imagination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Highlights of the Fleet Action 2 combat system...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Modular design allows for easier expansion&amp;#10;     Combined arms mechanics encouraging the use of speciality ships such as escorts and carriers&amp;#10;     A myriad of types of weapons, each with their own strengths &amp;amp; weaknesses&amp;#10;     Streamlines combat rules allowing for large numbers of warships&amp;#10;     Simple but flexible fighter rules make large numbers of fighters simple to wield&amp;#10;     Powerful and robust custom design rules allow for the design of new weapons, ships, ammunition types and fighters&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Notes: This was published as a loose-leaf rulebook, pre-drilled for 4-ring binders. Originally intended to update Fleet Action in the Babylon 5 universe, Agents of Gaming lost the franchise during development, and so developed a setting of near-space settlement with various Earth nations and coalitions as the factions. An extensive line of miniatures was planned , but only the first few released before AoG ceased trading and closed it's doors for the final time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
