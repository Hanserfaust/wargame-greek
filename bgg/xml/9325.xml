    <description>Sub-title:&amp;quot;Russia vs Japan&amp;quot;. The contents include: a Ziploc &amp;quot;Baggie&amp;quot; to store the game components; a 17-inches by 22-inches paper Map sheet; a set of 80 thin cardboard counters; and a 2-color 4-pages RULES folder while players will have to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE for play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10; The Map sheet is overall TAN with BLUE water features and BLACK for all other terrain to include: Rough; Fortified; Rail; Roads; &amp;amp; Towns/Cities. The Combat units represent Regiments/Brigades/Divisions and there are Headquarters for the Russian. The RULES folder has the back page containing the Set-up and Command Control Table(Russian) while on the REVERSE side are the Turn Record Track/Combat Results Table/Terrain Effects Chart. Players may want to make copies of these Tables/Charts prior to play to facilitate their use while allowing the RULES to be made available for consultation. &amp;#10; The Japanese player goes first with the following Sequence of play: 1.Supply Judgment phase; 2.Movement phase; 3.Combat phase, after which the Russian follows THIS Sequence of Play: 1.Command Control phase; 2.Supply Judgment phase; 3.Movement phase; 4.Combat phase. The Russian's Command phase is intended to represent the ineptness and confusion amongst the leaders of that side's forces. There are Special Rules for Japanese Artillery(allowing Bombardment from NON-adjacent hexes), Cavalry, tracing Supply along the RAIL lines, and Fortifications. There is only 1 Scenario beginning February 27 through March 16, 1905 with TURNS representing 1 Day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is another of the company's easy and concise games which they managed to produce at a time when most other companies were intent on more extensive and intensively detailed gameplay. THAT would only drive up the COST, and not only monetarily but in TIME consumed by players having to LEARN sheer volumes of Rules in order to begin to play.  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
