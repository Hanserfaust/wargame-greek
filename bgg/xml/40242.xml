    <description>Scenario book for Nuts!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d never been so damn cold. The snow was flying sideways like, we could hardly see a thing. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen a Panther before, and hearing it clanking up put the fear into me, right to my toes. They hit us hard and fast, knocked us dead. Fierce, them SS Krauts. Even though they were people just like us, scared all to Hell, they fought like no one else. That was The Bulge to me; freezing cold, Kraut tanks, and horror. Horror all around me. Even when we started winning.&amp;rdquo; &amp;#10;-Conversation with Lee Johnson, 391st Engineers, Ardennes veteran.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On December 16th, 1944, three German Panzer Armies hurled themselves at surprised Allied lines in the Ardennes area. This desperate bid to drive to the English Channel for a second time, attempting to recapture the port of Antwerp and forcing the Allies to sue for peace, would be called The Battle of the Bulge. In the end, this massive offensive would fail, costing the Germans the war. But it could have gone differently. PEIPER AT THE GATES is a mini-campaign of branching linked scenarios set during the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper and the 1st SS Panzer Division towards the Meuse River.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Smash through all opposition as the Germans, capturing the bridges at Trios Ponts and driving into the American far-rear. Hold the Panzer advance at Stavelot, stopping them cold with a small rag-tag band of American fighting men. Fight the climatic battle of a lone King Tiger against massed Sherman tanks as Task Force McGeorge attacks the La Gleize Cauldron from the north. Play solo or with friends. Play the Germans. Play the Americans. But just play. The fate of the Western Front is in your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
