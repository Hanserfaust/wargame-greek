    <description>For the casual reader who looks into the &amp;ldquo;100 Days&amp;rdquo; and the Waterloo Campaign, one of the early questions is, &amp;ldquo;Who (the heck) is Grouchy?&amp;rdquo; Followed up by wondering why (on earth) Napoleon would give this guy a third of his army and depend on him to keep Bl&amp;uuml;cher&amp;rsquo;s Prussians far from Wellington.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In context of Grouchy&amp;rsquo;s performance then, it&amp;rsquo;s a very reasonable question. But the answer goes back to February,1814, where - at the Battle of Vauchamps &amp;ndash; then-Cavalry-General Grouchy showed he could be extremely good at chasing Bl&amp;uuml;cher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vauchamps is one of those interesting battles mostly lost in the blur of &amp;ldquo;the 1814 Campaign,&amp;rdquo; where Napoleon kept giving bloody noses to the advancing allied armies but never quite had the strength for a decisive victory. Few Allied noses were as far out in front as that of Marshal Bl&amp;uuml;cher. There, in a small chapter called the &amp;ldquo;Six Days Campaign,&amp;rdquo; Napoleon dealt the &amp;ldquo;Army of Silesia&amp;rdquo; defeat after defeat. Reeling from this, Bl&amp;uuml;cher tried to disengage from Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s personal attention and attack an isolated corps under Marmont, with a mostly infantry force that included the names Zeiten, Pirch, and Kleist that we would see in 1815.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But &amp;ldquo;Boney&amp;rdquo; anticipated that move and turned the tables on Bl&amp;uuml;cher&amp;rsquo;s Prussians and Russians, who were advancing with little cavalry. For one time in 1814, Napoleon had more horses engaged and used them well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Battle of Vauchamps can be seen in three phases...Bl&amp;uuml;cher advancing while Marmont falls back toward reinforcement, Marmont&amp;rsquo;s counterattack, and Bl&amp;uuml;cher&amp;rsquo;s shock at discovering &amp;ldquo;the Ogre&amp;rdquo; again confronting him and falling back. Phase 3 is a long pursuit action - French cavalry hounding Allied squares (and breaking several!) Had the ground been less muddy (allowing the French horse artillery to stay closer), things would have been even worse for the Allies. As it was, in the final count, Allied losses may have been greater than 10-1 over the French, and Bl&amp;uuml;cher (once again) was very nearly captured.&amp;#10;[publisher's description]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;La Bataille de Vauchamps is the 2013 ATO Annual.
