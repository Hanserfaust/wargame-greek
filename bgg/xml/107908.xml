    <description>Blitzkrieg Undone: The Battle of Hannut: May 12-13, 1940, is a low complexity level game of the battle between the Allied Armed forces and Germany's Wehrmacht on May 12th and 13th, 1940 at Hannut, Belgium (near Gembloux). Hannut was the largest tank battle to yet occur during the Second World War. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The Allies anticipated the Germans would strike through neutral Belgium as they had in WWI, and planned on confronting them there on the Belgian plain. The first large scale encounter occurred at Hannut, not far from the famous battlefields of Ramillies and Waterloo. Here the 1st and 2nd French Light Mechanized Divisions, heavily armed with tanks, ran into the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players, taking on the roles of the commander of the 1st French Army and German Army Group B during the Battle for Belgium.  The French, thinking that this was the main German effort, committed their most modern divisions to this battle.  For the Germans, this was a feint to tie down the French (and destroy their best units) while Army Group A raced through the Ardennes to the English Channel, to encircle the best Allied Armies. Tactically, the French were successful at Hannut.  Strategically, the Germans accomplished their goal of &amp;quot;soaking off&amp;quot; the French armor away from the main effort through the Ardennes, however the French 1st Army survived the campaign and was later instrumental in protecting the Dunkirk pocket, allowing hundreds of thousands of English and French troops to evacuate to England.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the sixth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&amp;#10;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer&amp;#10;Units: Company&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map (in 2 parts)&amp;#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&amp;#10;One 8-page rulebook&amp;#10;One Player aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Low&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
