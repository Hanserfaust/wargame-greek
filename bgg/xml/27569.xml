    <description>Naval Warfare, 1560-1603&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now then, what's Sail!  like anyway?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We were after something more than fast play, but much less than complexity. These rules were originally meant for each model to represent more than one ship, and you can still play it that way. However at one-to-one it works best. As is our way, we wanted players to feel like they were playing their favorite navies. The tactics of one fleet will not work for another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Which nations are represented?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have decided to start out with Spanish/Portuguese, English and Dutch navies. French and Hansards are provided for to a lesser extent. Other navies, particularly Danish and Swedish, will be the subjects of later supplements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How many ships can you play a side?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can have from one ship per side up to forty, and still have a good time. As you'll see below, the game is intriguingly uncomplicated without being &amp;quot;fast play&amp;quot;, meaning no engagement is too small, and the larger battles can still be played without overly bogging down. We suggest each player control no more than 15-20 ships each, so with several players per side (and a big enough board) you could re-fight the whole Armada campaign!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Does it take long to play?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We finished a game with 15 ships per side in less than 90 minutes. Yet we do not consider&amp;#10;these rules &amp;quot;fast play&amp;quot; (in other words, sacrificing too much realism for speed)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Do I have to write anything down?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now you know how the Captain feels about record keeping..... Pen and paper are not required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
