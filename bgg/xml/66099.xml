    <description>The battle by Union forces to retake the planet Bey was difficult at best, a slaughter at the worst, as the resistance encountered against the robotic Morpheans proved to be more difficult than expected.  After months of fighting, the Unions 15th  Combined Army commanded by Marshall Jean Baptiste, managed to break the Morphean siege lines among the hills and mountains of the sprawling Blade River valley.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Blade River valley ran for hundreds of miles, and at dozens of locations throughout it, fierce battles took place for possession of key locations.  Bridges, power-plants, military training bases, and transportation docks were its lifeblood and the focal point of the fighting.  The 15th CA was reinforced by Union shock troops and mechs, enabling them to push the Morpheans back and eventually out of the valley area.  Mustering it's reserve units, the Morpheans responded in force, not willing to concede defeat to the inferior humans.  Wave upon wave of Morphean aero-fighters and bombers swept up the river valley in a final attempt to re-secure their dominance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bomber Run on Blade River is a 1-8 player game where the player or players take on the role of the skeletal Morphean robots with their aero-fighters and bombers, or the defending Union force with their missile equipped infantry squads, armored walkers, anti-aero guns and counter-fighters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack on Blade River Valley is a free PnP consisting of a 9 page rulebook, 4 map pages (when all are combined), and a sheet of unit counters.  In addition, the player will need about 6-8 d6.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was designed to be played at work station or table, depending on how many of the map pieces the player/s wish to use.  When all the map pieces are placed together they cover an area the size of 4 sheets of 8.5x11 paper.  The simplest form of the game uses just one sheet (To be added shortly).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
