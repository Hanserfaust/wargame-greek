    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Battle of Trafalgar (1805 AD)"/>
    <description>&amp;ldquo;The decisive naval battle of the Napoleonic era occurred when a British fleet of 27 ships under the commander of Admiral Horatio Nelson engaged a Franco-Spanish fleet of 33 ships. Nelson devised a daring strategy to overcome his opponents. He divided his force into two squadrons, which attacked the center of the Allied fleet at right angles. Nelson led one of the squadrons into action aboard the Victory. The plan was a smashing success. The Allied fleet was crushed, losing twenty ships. The British didn't lose any ships, but a French sniper killed Nelson. This battle ended forever Napoleon's dream of invading Britain, and the Royal Navy would dominate the seas for the next century.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table. Free print-and-play paper miniatures (flats) are provided for use with the rules. The rules cover fouling, grappling, boarding, cannon fire, drifting, and wind effects. &amp;#10; Colored yarn is taped around the edges of the game table to give a quick visual guide to the effect of the wind based on the color a ship is facing. &amp;ldquo;If the ship is pointing towards the green then the wind is behind the ship . . . If the ship is pointing towards the yellow it is close quartered . . . If a ship is pointing towards the red then it is &amp;lsquo;locked in irons&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; and must pass a skill roll to move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
