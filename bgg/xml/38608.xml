    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Battle of King's Mountain (1780 AD)"/>
    <description>&amp;ldquo;The Battle of King&amp;rsquo;s Mountain was not fought between British troops and American Regulars. It was Americans fighting against their neighbors, family and friends. Major Ferguson was the Loyalist commander and was a part of Lord Cornwallis&amp;rsquo; army.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;On October 7th 1780, Ferguson set up a camp on King&amp;rsquo;s Mountain. The Continental Army under the command of Col. Shelby surrounded Ferguson on the mountain and proceeded to shoot down his men. Some of the Americans had rifles and were able to pick off the Loyalists at the top of the hill. The Loyalists attempted to drive off the Patriots with bayonet charges but each time they were cut down by musket and rifle fire.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 2x1 meter table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The center of the game table is dominated by the mountain. The Loyalist forces begin deployed around the camp on top of the mountain, while the Patriots deploy anywhere around the mountain. To win the game the Patriots must capture or remove all Loyalist troops from the mountain and kill Major Ferguson.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
