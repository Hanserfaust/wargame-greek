    <description>I designed BOB to be the last word on low to medium complexity Bulge games. I enjoy playing Bulge games but I never found one that satisfied me. So I decided to make my own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BASTOGNE OR BUST is a single-map, regimental treatment of the Battle of the Bulge. This is a PLAYER'S game! Designed on purpose to be more of a warGAME than a simulation. It addresses a number of pet peeves of mine in regard to Bulge games I'd played over the years. Some of these issues include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OFF BOARD MOVEMENT CHART [what happens to all those pieces that 'exit the map?']&amp;#10;STACKING POINTS [one of the greatest mechanics of all time - why don't designers use it more often?]&amp;#10;COMMAND &amp;amp; CONTROL [divisional bonuses for unit cohesiveness]&amp;#10;SUPPLY DIFFERENCES [different effects on ALLIES vs GERMANS]&amp;#10;INITIATIVE [essentially, the 5-1 column on the CRT is gone]&amp;#10;NO OVERRUN [squads held crossroads against regiments]&amp;#10;NO WEATHER RULES [weather is reflected in air support]&amp;#10;VON DER HYDTE [ALWAYS gets on the board]&amp;#10;STREAMLINED PLAY [I don't need water allocation points]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Referred to affectionately by wargamers as BOB, I like to refer to it as The World's Finest Bulge Game. All of the artwork was done by myself - including the counters which were hand drawn!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map [printed on four 11&amp;quot; x 17&amp;quot; cardstock sheets]&amp;#10;600 counters [printed on 2 sheets of 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; label paper]&amp;#10;2 OOB/OOA set-up sheets&amp;#10;1 OFF-BOARD MOVEMENT CHART&amp;#10;2 Player Aid Cards&amp;#10;1 example sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the original TERRAN GAMES dtp publication of BOB showcased at ORIGINS '94 in San Jose, not the TERRAN GAMES, INC. version published a year later with all new [gorgeous] graphics by Mark Simonitch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
