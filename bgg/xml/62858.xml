    <description>During the summer of 1918, Turkey created its &amp;ldquo;Army of Islam&amp;rdquo; con-sisting of the 5th, 15th Divisions, later the 10th also joined. Having been defeated in Palestine, the Turks looked for easier prey and this was the Trancaucasus-Caspian area of Azerbaijan. This newly formed country asked Turkey for protection from the Bolsheviks, which also wanted the area. The Reds were defeated in late June but they remained in control of Baku until mid July. Turkey, like the British, saw Baku&amp;rsquo;s worth in its oil and ordered its army to march hundreds of miles to seize it despite Germany&amp;rsquo;s strong protests (who wanted it also through political means). By the end of July, the Turks were fast approaching Baku. This prompted the British to send Dunsterforce, 1000 men, to Baku, all arrived in the nick of time. The situation for the British was dire from the start. In manpower, the odds were 10 to 1 in favor of the Turks!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
