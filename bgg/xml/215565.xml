    <description>Volume XI of the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series, Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North covers some of the most famous campaigns of the Civil War in a single module that represents the largest collection of content ever produced for the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series.  Based on previously published materials, each of the three campaigns included in Roads to Gettysburg II has been revised, repackaged, and rebalanced for improved play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Here Come the Rebels Here Come the Rebels (which covers the 1862 Antietam Campaign) has had each Basic Game scenario rebalanced, one new scenario added, and a full reworking of the victory conditions for the two Advanced Game scenarios.&amp;#10;    Roads to Gettysburg Roads to Gettysburg (which covers the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign) includes five new scenarios, four rebalanced existing scenarios, and a significantly revised Advanced Game that covers the full scope of Lee&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Pennsylvania.&amp;#10;    Rebels in the White House Rebels in the White House (which covers Early&amp;rsquo;s 1864 Raid on Washington) is a quick-playing module that was originally included in the Skirmisher II magazine and has now been fully brought up to current publication standards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The four maps included are painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler and have been significantly revised to include all the latest GCACW terrain types including hills, swamps, dams, trails and landings.  The military unit counters have been redesigned by Charlie Kibler to harken back to the counters in the original games in the series but with a more modern graphical treatment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North contains an updated version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all the other games in the series use.  The Advanced Game rules are also standardized so players will be able to move quickly from one campaign to the other. This package contains a massive collection of eighteen Basic Game scenarios and five Advanced Game campaigns, divided as shown between the three modules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here Come the Rebels II includes one new Basic Game scenario, the five original Basic Scenarios redesigned and rebalanced, and the two original Advanced Game campaign scenarios extensively revised:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    South Mountain (1 turn, September 14, 1862)&amp;#10;    Harpers Ferry-Crampton&amp;rsquo;s Gap (4 turns, September 12 &amp;ndash; September 15, 1862)&amp;#10;    McClellan&amp;rsquo;s Opportunity (3 turns, September 15 &amp;ndash; September 17, 1862)&amp;#10;    Three Cigars (6 turns, September 13 &amp;ndash; September 18, 1862; new scenario)&amp;#10;    The Baltimore Raid (7 turns, September 10 &amp;ndash; September 16, 1862)&amp;#10;    The Battle for Washington (3 turns, September 12 &amp;ndash; September 14, 1862)&amp;#10;    From Frederick to Sharpsburg (9 turns, September 10 &amp;ndash; September 18, 1862; Advanced Game scenario)&amp;#10;    The Maryland Campaign (18 turns, September 4 &amp;ndash; September 21, 1862; Advanced Game scenario)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roads to Gettysburg II includes five new Basic Game scenarios, the four original Basic Scenarios redesigned and rebalanced, and the original Advanced Game campaign extensively revamped for better playability and play balance:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Meade Moves North (5 turns, June 29 &amp;ndash; July 3, 1863; revised)&amp;#10;    Stuart Rides North (4 turns, June 29 &amp;ndash; July 2, 1863; new cavalry scenario)&amp;#10;    Confederate High Tide (3 turns, June 29 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1863; solitaire scenario)&amp;#10;    First Day at Gettysburg (1 turn, July 1, 1863; revised)&amp;#10;    Battle of Gettysburg (3 turns, July 1-3, 1863; new battle scenario)&amp;#10;    The Pipe Creek Plan (6 turns, July 1-6, 1863; new maneuver &amp;amp; battle scenario)&amp;#10;    The Battle Continues (2 turns, July 4-5, 1863; new, from Skirmisher I)&amp;#10;    The Wagoneer&amp;rsquo;s Fight (3 turns, July 4-6, 1863; new cavalry scenario)&amp;#10;    The Battle that Never Happened (8 turns, July 5-12, 1863; revised)&amp;#10;    The Gettysburg Campaign (18 turns, June 22-July 9, 1863; Advanced Game scenario, revised)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rebels in the White House includes three Basic Game scenarios and two Advanced Game scenarios:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Monocacy (1 turn, July 9, 1864)&amp;#10;    Fort Stevens (2 turns, July 11 &amp;ndash; July 12, 1864)&amp;#10;    The Retreat from Washington (6 turns, July 13 &amp;ndash; July 18, 1864)&amp;#10;    From Winchester to Washington (13 turns, July 3 &amp;ndash; July 15, 1864; Advanced Game scenario)&amp;#10;    Early&amp;rsquo;s Raid (20 turns, July 1 &amp;ndash; July 20, 1864; Advanced Game scenario)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[The third and fifth scenarios require use of the Stonewall Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Way II north map (Volume IX in the GCACW series) which is not included.]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North contains:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    GCACW Series Rules Booklet (24 pgs in color) &amp;#10;    RTGII Specific Rules Booklet 120 pgs in color including scenarios, the game as history, map gazetteer, etc) &amp;#10;    Four 22&amp;quot;x 32&amp;quot; full-color map sheets&amp;#10;    Four 280-piece counter sheets&amp;#10;    One Terrain Effects Chart&amp;#10;    Two full-color Force Displays &amp;#10;    Two 4-page color Charts and Tables &amp;#10;    Two 6-sided Dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roads to Gettysburg II: Lee Strikes North credits:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Design &amp;amp; Development: Ed Beach, Mike Belles, and Chris Withers&amp;#10;    Original series design by Joe Balkoski &amp;#10;    Map Artwork by Charlie Kibler&amp;#10;    Counter Graphics by Charlie Kibler and Nicolas Eskubi&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
