    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Omaha:  The Battle for the Beach"/>
    <description>Omaha: The Battle for the Beach is a free-for-downloading game available from the Armchair General website.  A Download Key is required; this is available to purchasers of the July 2004 issue of the magazine.  The download itself consists of a zipped Adobe Acrobat file, from which the downloader will need to print 10 pages of rules, tables, counters, and the map.  A color printer is recommended, but the game can be played on a black-and-white printout.  The rules are designed for easy assimilation and allow for a two-player game or a solitaire American player.  The download page contains a short historical background of the Omaha beach landing and several paragraphs of designer's notes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UPDATE:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game has been redeveloped by the new LnLP staff improving the counters, maps, rules, and scenarios in the game.
