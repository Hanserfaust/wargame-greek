    <name type="primary" sortindex="5" value="The Baltic Wars"/>
    <description>This is a very small wargame covering the whole of The Baltic Wars of the early 1700s. The three players represent Poland, Sweden, and Russia, as well as a collection of lesser allied powers. Production, political influence, and status are all kept on a small score sheet.  Victory is determined by victory points based on captured cities and aggregate political influence. The mechanics of this game are very similar to The Thirty Years War by the same designer and publisher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This definitely was a &amp;quot;budget&amp;quot; wargame, retailing for $1.79 in 1980.  The counters were printed on thin cardboard and had to be cut out with scissors.  All other components are paper, including an 11&amp;quot;x17&amp;quot; map, the cover sheets, and 5 double-sided copies of the score sheet, all in a 4&amp;quot;x6&amp;quot; ziplock bag.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
