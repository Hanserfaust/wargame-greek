    <description>A tactical WWII wargame that was published in the first issue of JagdPanther magazine. Eight generic scenarios were included for portraying conflicts involving German, American, and Russian forces. MP-44 is currently available in PDF format as Amarillo Design Bureau has digitally rereleased all fifteen JagdPanther issues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mp44 [sic] is a squad level (10-12 man) game of infantry combat in WWII. In many ways it is the illigitemate [sic] child of Panzerblitz and Grunt. But it is distinctive and in many ways superior to both ... In this game we have squads of 14 men, and we have teams of two ... Some may complain that the game is too close to Panzerblitz. Well, part of that us intentional. I saw no reason to require the gamer to learn a new game system when most are familiar with Panzerblitz. For that reason, I left the factors where they were on the counter, and used, for all practical purposes, the same CRT ... Besides, this game is sort of a companion to PzB, allowing you to get closer to the action. Basically, we had to contend with Bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles, machine pistols, and machine guns. Assault rifles are also included, and the heavier fire factors are indicative of the fire-generation of these weapons. The Vietnam type infantry provided for the Americans include not only assault rifles, but Grenade Launchers - pocket cannon ... German paratroopers might carry rifles, smg, or assault rifles ... Any differences in the relative intelligence or training or minor differences in weapons are reflected in reduced or increased range, reflecting more or less disciplined fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
