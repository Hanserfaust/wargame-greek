    <description>Sub-title:&amp;rdquo; The Battle for Germany, 1866&amp;quot;. Contents comprise the following: A 17-inches by 22-inches Map sheet; a 2-pages Rules folder; a paper sheet with the Turn Record Track/Melee Combat Results Table/Fire Combat Results Table/Initiative Table; and a thin Front &amp;amp; Back printed uncut Counter Sheet. Players will have to provide their OWN single 6-sided DIE &amp;amp; CUTOUT the game Counters prior to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Map sheet is overall TAN with all terrain features in BROWN with BLUE numerals &amp;amp; water features. The counter sheet is mostly WHITE (Austrians) with BLUE (Prussians) and printed in BLACK. The Rules folder is more like just 3 pages as the FRONT is the cover with the game title graphics. The game mechanics for the sequence of play is: 1.Initiative Determination-Either Player Rolls a DIE and consults the Table to see which player goes first; 2.FIRE phase-BOTH players attempt to recover previously Disrupted Units from an earlier FIRE phase THEN Simultaneous Fire is conducted by BOTH player's eligible Units; 3.MOVEMENT phase-The Phasing Player may move his Undisrupted Units; 4.MELEE phase-BOTH players attempt to recover previously Disrupted Units from an earlier MELEE phase and THEN the Phasing Player may conduct MELEE with eligible adjacent Units; once BOTH players have performed these phases, then a TURN is marked off and play continues until the end of the game is reached.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The RULES folder details the extensive Historical Unit designation abbreviations for the Combat Units. On the back page is located the Terrain Effects table with explanations, the Victory Conditions, and a Historical Notes section. Very concise and easy to learn or follow for any level of War gamer to comprehend.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
