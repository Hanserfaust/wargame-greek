    <description>(from the publisher:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The War Between The States near Hilton Head Island and Beaufort, South Carolina.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Includes:  a color 2' x 3' mapboard (unmounted),  280  first-rate 1/2&amp;quot; playing pieces,  a 24 page Advanced Game Rules booklet,  a 24 page Basic Game Rules booklet,  a 20 page Historical Background booklet, and hard stock Sequence of Play,  Fire Combat, and  Charge Combat  Summary Sheets (all are 8 1/2&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot;),  plus Ammunition Charts and other Player Aid Cards. Seven half-map scenarios, six full-map scenarios, game scale is 350 yards, per 5/8&amp;quot; hexagon, with each Game Turn representing 30 minutes. The Basic Rules were added for younger players.&amp;#10; Very accurate and comprehensive, the game includes rules and counters for Federal Naval Vessels,  Confederate Trains,  Federal Engineers,  Leaders,  Ammunition Depletion,  Damaged and Destroyed Bridges, and  Captured Cannon.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The Basic Game is a fast playing simulation of advancing along the narrow roads and through the thick coastal forests and swamps of southwestern South Carolina.  The Confederate player must choose the right times to fall back, or risk being overwhelmed by the Yankee aggressor.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The Advanced Rules include Skirmishers,  Hidden Movement,  Breastworks and Fortifications, Tides and Naval Grounding, and  Alternative Federal Landing Sites.  Individual cannon types are represented in both field and naval artillery units.  Ammunition usage is an important aspect of command decisions.  This is a very well-researched wargame.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The Sequence of Play is a variation of the Original GBOCW System, with Fire Combat, including any Defensive and Return Fire, taking place before Charge Combat.&amp;#10;     This game is an excellent simulation, and an enjoyable game as well, and was the best gaming effort by the leading historian of these particular engagements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
