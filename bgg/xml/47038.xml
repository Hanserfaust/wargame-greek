    <description>The Revised and Expanded edtion of the 2006 book Africa&amp;#10; North Africa&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On 29 August the revised edition of North Africa will hit the shelves. This mighty tome comes in at 264 pages and takes into account the feedback we have received over the years since Afrika was initially released, as well as new research that the team has unearthed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first major change is that not only is North Africa much larger than its predecessor, but it will also be in hard cover. This means that it will stand up to the rigors of gaming like never before as we give our Late War armies a break and head back to North Africa and Italy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second major change is that a number of the companies have been split up into Africa, Tunisia or Italy lists. This means we have been able to more accurately represent the forces fighting in each of the theatres. The organisation diagrams for choosing your company have also been changed to the new style. This makes it much easier for new and experienced players to put a force together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last major change is that we have added in some of the new units that you have come to see regularly in Late War such as heavy artillery, as well some new ones like British 3.7cm AA guns. &amp;#10; As a result of the increased size (50+ pages larger than before) we have also been forced to increase the retail price of the book, making it the same price as the rulebook. Taking customer feedback into account regarding Fortress Europe we felt that it was important to include all the lists that you knew and loved (as well as a few more that will become favourites), rather than dropping anything out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;North Africa will be in stores 29 August 2009!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
