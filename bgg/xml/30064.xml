    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Battle Box: WWII (Europe)"/>
    <description>A simple and fast boardgame contained within a box.  One page of rules, fantastic graphics on the map, 20 plastic miniatures, dice, and hours of simple war gaming fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is not designed to simulate, it is a game.  Fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, and even mothers with children will love the simplicity and speed (most games last less than 30 minutes).  Old school gamers will also love it as a quick fix game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is 1940.  Players choose the Allies or the Axis to play.  The board has preset armies for both side that begin on the board.  A game last 15 turns unless a clear winner before then.  Some turns have preset first phase players, some the players dice for initiative.  On those turns player get to go first automatically, they also receive reinforcements.  Essentially, the allies must hold out until mid-game or they are going to loose.  The Germans must win quick, or the allies will eventually overwhelm them.  Hey! Just like the real war...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses very simple mechanics for movement and combat, and it is in no way a simulation.  The idea is to provide a &amp;quot;beer and pretzels&amp;quot; game for those who don't have time to play a more involved wargame.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The concept behind the Battle Box series is simple and fun:  Play when you can.  The game is perfect for introducing young would be generals to wargaming, as even as early as 10 years old the rules and concepts are easily grasped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Available at  www.flamingmonkeygames.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
