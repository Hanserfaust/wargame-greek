    <description>La Bataille de Leipzig 1813 - La Bataille de Wiederitzsch 1813&amp;#10;&amp;#10;La Bataille de Wiederitzsch depicts an encounter during the Battle of Nations, fought in October 1813 in and around Leipzig.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At La Bataille de Wiederitzsch, the French position is anchored by Jan Dombrowski&amp;rsquo;s independent command of the 27th Division of Poles, and later supported by Delmas&amp;rsquo; 9th Division of French and various Rhine Confederation Cavalry.  This force is greatly outnumbered by the &amp;Eacute;migr&amp;eacute; French General Langeron&amp;rsquo;s wing of the Army of Silesia, consisting of the IX and X Corps of Russian and Prussian forces.  These two corps, with tremendous artillery support, have an overwhelming superiority in numbers over the French Imperial forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle, which saw the Coalition forces push the Poles and French out of the Wiederitzsch after three brutal hours of combat, was among the most intensive of any of the battles in the Leipzig cycle.  Historically, the twin villages change hands several times.  Marshal Enterprises has developed special rules to reflect the gruesome nature of the conflict, and the almost mystical determination of the Poles to prevail over their hated Russian neighbors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New rules for the players to consider are the effects of Elite Units, Landwehr skirmishing, Russian Dragoon&amp;rsquo;s abilities, improved towns, dusk combat, the loyalties of certain units, command structures and plundering. Besides the historical battle, four scenarios are included. These provide for a cavalry on cavalry only battle, inspired attacks by von Bluecher and the ability to jump into combat for the struggle of Moeckern itself. This scenario will end whenever a player reaches a threshold casualties and disintegration of order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
