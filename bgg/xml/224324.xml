    <description>Grochow 1831 covers fours battles of the Polish November Uprising, the war between Kingdom of Poland (an autonomical part of Russia after the Vienna Congress) and the Empire of Russian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The First Battle of Wawer was fought on February 19 and 20, 1831. Polish forces, led by Jan Skrzynecki, defeated Russian 1st Corps, commanded by Hans Karl von Diebitsch. After the battle, Polish commander did not receive any reinforcements, so the victory was not decisive and Polish army had to move back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle of Olszynka Grochowska was the largest battle of the November Uprising and biggest in Europe since the battle of Waterloo.[citation needed] It was fought on 25 February in the woods near Groch&amp;oacute;w, at the eastern outskirts of Warsaw. Both sides suffered heavy losses and none of them was able to call itself victorious, but sinces Polish army managed to stop Russian advance on Warsaw, historians look at this battle as Polish tactical victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Battle of D&amp;#196;&amp;#153;be Wielkie was fought on 31 March 1831. The Polish army, led by Jan Skrzynecki, won over Russian curtain forces commanded by General Geismar. It was first battle of the Polish ofensive planned by general Pr&amp;#196;&amp;#133;dzy&amp;#197;&amp;#132;ski.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Battle of Iganie was fought on 10 April 1831. It was one of the last major battles of the November Uprising and the last major offensive for the Poles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game uses &amp;quot;Napoleon&amp;quot; brigade/regiment-based system, with typical hex and counter mechanics, along with &amp;quot;I move - you move&amp;quot; driven system. It has rather easy rules, prepared for most of the battles of the first half of the XIX century.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios:&amp;#10; Groch&amp;oacute;w 1809&amp;#10;- Groch&amp;oacute;w 1831&amp;#10;- Wawer 1831&amp;#10;- Wawer II&amp;#10;- Iganie&amp;#10;- D&amp;#196;&amp;#153;be Wielkie&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
