    <description>Platoon Leader comes in a solid booklet format, complete with all errata for previous Historical SQUADS &amp;amp; LEADERS modules from CH, a newly-designed purchase record table, and all the charts you need for quick reference on a back cover play aid. You'll find the cover of PL 2.5 depicted at the top of the left column of this web page. Overall, it's a very nice package for Campaign Gaming, as everything you need to conduct the campaign is right in the booklet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Platoon Leader campaign game rules for Historical SQUADS &amp;amp; LEADERS enthusiasts are now available in version 2.5. As the version number suggests, this is still PL 2 at heart, but with many improvements. More than just a minor upgrade, this is an under-the-hood overhaul that was expressly aimed at making the existing line of modules easier and more fun to play. In fact, our testers report that these rules work great for RB, PB and KGP, too! Head to the bottom of this page for links to the latest version.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The approach was simple: bring in some of the system's harshest critics and some top talent for a down-to-earth review of the strengths and weaknesses of the system. A round table was conducted by our PL team, with many other folks providing comments and insight. The resulting enhancements, fixes and improvements make PL more user-friendly without introducing any major changes to familiar terms and methods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Platoon Leader provides one set of rules to learn before embarking on your personal 'campaigning' to the different 'fronts' CH has and will continue to bring you. (In recent months, North Africa, PTO, France 40, Normandy, Market Garden and more.) And since it's a rulebook aimed at campaigns only, the emphasis is on enhancing that particular gaming experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expanded by:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    The Sunrise Bridge&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
