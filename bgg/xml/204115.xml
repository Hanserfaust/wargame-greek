    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Napoleon's Last Gamble: Expansion Kit I – The Highway to Bruxelles"/>
    <description>This Expansion Kit I requires the use of the game equipment for OSG&amp;rsquo;s  Napoleon's Last Gamble. The Southern Expansion map is used for the Crossing of the Sambre. The Grand Campaign uses the Scenario Information for starting on June 15th (34.0), adding the Northern map Extension (35.0).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New Scenarios added:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; # 34.0 = CROSSING THE SAMBRE 15 June, 1815 &amp;#10;Around 9 AM Prussian outposts fell back before elements of Reille&amp;rsquo;s II Corps and Domon&amp;rsquo;s horsemen. As Steinmetz retired on Gosseilles, Pirch was ordered to abandon the river line and concentrate on Gilly.  Pajol&amp;rsquo;s Cavalry Corps followed-up, moving through Charleroi. Duhesme&amp;rsquo;s Young Guard took the place of the delayed III Corps. With the defection of General Bourmont, commander of IV Corps&amp;rsquo;s lead division, the ensuing chaos delayed Gerard&amp;rsquo;s marching columns.   The limited number of bridges on the Sambre, with their steep and narrow approaches, caused great delays, even with the Prussians scrambling to get away. This scenario is a race against time, to see if the French player can get into a better position for the battles of the 16th.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; # 35.0 = THE GRAND CAMPAIGN GAME - Beyond Waterloo, 15-19 June, 1815 &amp;#10;The Grand Campaign uses the Scenario Information for 15 June (34.0), except for the end dates and the additional special rules below.  The Grand Campaign uses the Northern map Extension to extend the game through the 19th.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; # 36.0 = THE BATTLE OF IXELLES 19 June, 1815 &amp;#10;Napoleon expected to fight the united Prussian and Anglo-Allied Armies in front of Brussels. This scenario assumes that none of the Prussians marched from Wavre to support Wellington. Hence the Duke would have fought only a medium-sized rearguard action at Waterloo, buying time his army to arrive near Brussels. &amp;ldquo;If the allied army had been obliged to fall back from Waterloo, the roads from Braine-l&amp;rsquo;Alleud, from Waterloo, and from Wavre, meet upon very strong ground about a mile and a half in front of Brussels&amp;mdash;the right ... at Uccle upon the Senne, its centre at Vleurgat, and its left thrown back at Ixelles.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, several Turn Record Charts and Anglo-Allied Setup Cards will be provided to account for the added map and associated arrival times on the WX map. No additional counters will be needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS: &amp;#10;&amp;bull; 2 Map Sheets: &amp;#10;  - one 11&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; and &amp;#10;  - one 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot;  &amp;#10;&amp;bull; 1 Rules Folder (4 pages) &amp;#10;&amp;bull; 3 Turn Record Card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
