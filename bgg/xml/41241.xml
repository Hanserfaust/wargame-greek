    <description>Fast and Dirty was designed to provide a quick, uncomplicated, yet realistic game system for small unit modern day, near future and sci-fi skirmish combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By building upon basic military principles that have not changed much over time, such as troop morale, motivation, and experience, these rules are an attempt to create a system that will serve just as well for fire fights today as those far off into the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player will field a small force, ranging from a few squads to a reinforced platoon with support elements, including heavy weapons, artillery, even a vehicle or two. Forces can be created in one of three ways: using a simple random force generation system to get you playing quickly, a more advanced system for experienced players, and a detailed points system for the ultimate in flexibility. Though the system is easy to learn and play, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the game is lacking details.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In fact, there are actually three levels of play. First you will learn the Basic Game, which provides all the core rules necessary to head off into battle. Then, as you become familiar with the system, you might want to consider using some of the Advanced Rules, which will add more depth to your gaming experience. Finally, there are a number of Optional Rules which you can incorporate into your games to add even greater detail. The choice is yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fast and Dirty is a generic system, specifically designed to work with a wide array of settings and miniatures. Feel free to devise your own worlds and forces, based upon the miniatures in your collection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
