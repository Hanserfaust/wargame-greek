    <description>Description From Rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IT is a Mini SF* game that you play by yourself or with one or two other people. It is fast, fun to play, and always exciting. The game is always different each time you play with four scenarios you can use depending on how much time you have and how many people are playing . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IT (tm) is the game where you design the monsterous [sic] &amp;quot;IT&amp;quot; war machine yourself; then try to take a planet with it . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;* Trade mark for the Micro Science Fiction Games of ATTACK INTERNATIONAL, the creators of modern S.F. Wargaming, and the first to create Mini SF* games.     &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IT is a straightforward, small-format sci-fi wargame that is reminiscent of another asymmetrical conflict between a behemoth machine and an array of lesser opposing forces (see Ogre).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, the opposing forces are IT, a sort of mega-tank or robot, versus the conventional forces seeking to defend a planetary base. The player controlling IT creates a customized war-machine design by allocating IT's 1000 mass/weight units. The variable characteristics include IT's speed, armor, weaponry, defensive systems, and (structural?) integrity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game turn consists of the first player moving any or all his units, followed by that player's combat phase. The second player then executes his own movement and combat phases, completing the turn. Terrain affects movement and combat, with line of sight being a factor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the standard IT versus conventional forces scenario, three additional scenarios are provided: a two-player conventional forces battle, a two-player IT versus IT battle, and a three-player battle royale where two of the players control an IT and the third player controls the conventional forces. Rules are also provided for a solitaire game in which the player controls IT against 20 random conventional force units that move and attack as determined by the game system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Advanced rules variations allow for plotted simultaneous movement and/or combat. Additional optional rules provide for opportunity fire and a two-player &amp;quot;Blind IT&amp;quot; game. The blind game uses two mapsheets so that the IT player can only see units visible to IT. The rules helpfully note that the blind &amp;quot;system only works with a conventional player who does not cheat.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
