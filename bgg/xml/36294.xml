    <description>Panzerschlacht- Das Spannende Brettspiel:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tank Battle - Exciting Board Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Little is known about how the game plays, the rules were not present but the map consists of a rectangular board with two color squares (likely representing terrain or impassable areas) and starting lines.  The units consist of two sizes of tanks (small and large), both made of wood with metal turrets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Addition: Each player has 10 small tanks and 8 big tanks. The tanks may move diagonaly in every direction. The small tanks have a moving range up to 6 spaces, while the big ones may move up to 4 spaces. Immediately after moving, the tanks may shot at an enemy tank. Shooting is only permitted straight ahead in the direction of the enemy encampment. The small tanks have a firing range of exactly 3 spaces, the big ones can shoot at tanks that are 3 or 4 spaces ahead. The dark green spaces can't be moved on, but can be shot over. When a tank is hit, it is removed from the game. If a tank neglects to shoot at an enemy, it may be removed by the enemy player. A tank, which has a friendly tank in the space in front of it, is protected from beeing shot at. If a tank reaches the enemy encampment, it reverses it's direction and attacks from the back. This makes a pincer tactic possible. The player who destroys the whole tank force of his opponent wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
