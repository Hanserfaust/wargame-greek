    <name type="primary" sortindex="5" value="The Lone Tank"/>
    <description>The game is set during World War Two, where you are a German tank commander who has to get his battle-worn tank safely back to friendly faces. The only way back is through a small village, but this contains elements of enemy infantry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a card driven game, and there are two types of card. Terrain cards, which is the pack you are trying to go through as quickly as possible, where the last card is always the Bridge card. There are also Event cards which mainly contain enemy soldiers. Each card has an activation number, the activation level is decided by shuffling activation cards into the Terrain deck. So the further into the village you go the more likely you are to meet enemy opposition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You give orders to your crew, spending order points. Example: prepare main tank gun, load main tank gun, move turret, observe etc. Your tank creates noise which attracts enemy soldiers and the terrain you move over may also have a bearing on this as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is a series of dice rolls, not everyone's favourite part of the game but most wargamers will be okay with this. Also included are the use of Sch&amp;uuml;rzen (side skirts), Zimmerit paste, PIAT attacks, a Sherman, and tank traps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
