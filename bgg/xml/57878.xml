    <name type="primary" sortindex="5" value="The Last Hurrah: Counterattack at Rostov! Feb., 1920"/>
    <description>The Last Hurrah covers the Denikin's last successful counterattack of the Russian Civil War in February, 1920. After months of constant retreats and loss, the Don River offered a respite. Even though the river was partially frozen, crossing proved difficult for either side except at one of the four bridges which span it. Weather and time also proved to be a friend of Denikin one last time, as both sides had to fight freezing temperatures and slowed the rapid advance of the Red Army chasing them into Rostov, a small city at the time. Much of the Red forces that reached the city were to too small and the main body of the army was still several days away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Denikin pulled his forces back to Bataisk and dug in and by the time the Red lead elements arrived, the Reds found themselves in a much weaker position because Denikin had gathered his units. Denikin planned for a quick offensive, one to retake Rostov and hopefully beyond to buy additional time before the inevitable. Retaking Rostov would also be a desperately needed morale boost. Thus, he gathered his last available Mk V tanks, aircraft, and reinforced his elite Volunteer Army. He suddenly struck, completely taking the Red units by surprise, routing many. Within a day or so, he entered Rostov, and pushed onto the suburbs along the fringe. The reversal was complete. Stunning. Morale rose. But, like the Germans and the Ardennes in 1944, the weight of the Red army was felt once it arrived. Bitter fighting in Rostov set the city on fire as the Whites fell back across the banks of the Don. It was their last hurrah!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comes with a 11x17&amp;quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about one mile per hex. Each combat unit is one battalion\brigade for non-AFV units. For Tanks ,Armor cars Aircraft, each counter is one AFV\AC. A game turn represents several hours of time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
