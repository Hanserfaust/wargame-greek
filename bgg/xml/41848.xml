    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Age of Imperialism"/>
    <description>Age of Imperialism is a game in which up to seven players compete to establish global empires during the century of 1815-1915. Players respond to ever-changing opportunities to invest in influence and colonial control in overseas territories to obtain wealth, strategic advantage, and prestige. Age of Imperialism substantially covers a full century of history with the shifts in technology, economic conditions, and politics that constantly changed the imperial equation. The future of the whole world has yet to be written; will Great Britain build an empire upon which the sun never sets, or will the French tricolour, the imperial Russian eagle, or the Stars and Stripes span the globe? &amp;#10;  'Age of Imperialism recreates the imperial expansion of Europe, America and Japan in the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical component with a game system that encourages careful planning and player interaction whilst avoiding much of the bookkeeping tedium of comparable games on the subject. Each player manages one of the great imperial powers, managing its resources to enough develop economic, diplomatic and military power to earn a &amp;quot;place in the sun&amp;quot;. Intended to teach as well as to entertain, the game addresses the causes nineteenth-century imperialism as well as its effects on international relations amongst the imperial powers. &amp;#10; Played on an authentic 19th-century map of the entire world, Age of Imperialism includes several scenarios, each playable in an afternoon, covering different stages of imperial expansion, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire century. It also includes rules for solitaire play. Complexity is medium (about 6/10).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
