    <description>(from the designer:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triumph of Fascism: The Spanish Civil War 1936&amp;ndash;1939 is a two-player a Card Driven Wargame: a board game integrating the political and military spheres of a historical conflict, with cards driving the action. Players assume the side of RED (Republican forces &amp;ndash; the elected government) and BLUE (anti-Republican forces/ &amp;rdquo;Nationalists&amp;rdquo;/ Fascists / Francoists &amp;ndash; those seeking to overthrow the elected government) in the Spanish Civil War (SCW). This epic conflict involved the toppling of a democratically elected government, its replacement by a totalitarian regime, significant foreign intervention, a major component in the march towards WWII and a struggle for control of Spain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each side begins enlisting its political &amp;ldquo;camps&amp;rdquo; (BLUE: Nationalist Army, Carlist, Falange and Army of Africa, RED: PCE, Republican Army, UGT, Anarchist, POUM, Cataluonia and the Northern Autonomous Governments ) to build their national armies and by gaining support from foreign powers (BLUE: Germany, Italy and Portugal, RED: Britain, France and Russia) to improve their resources to wage the conflict. Players will also decide their resource investment in force preparation: there is an &amp;ldquo;untried columns&amp;rdquo; mechanic very similar to one first utilized by Panzergruppe Guderian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three phases to a game turn: Strategic, Action and Logistics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Strategic Phase requires players to &amp;ldquo;spend&amp;rdquo; their Action Cards (think of ACs as currency) planning their turn, influencing political dynamics (enlisting support of &amp;ldquo;camps&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;foreign powers&amp;rdquo;), impacting the battle for hearts &amp;amp; minds, pursuing alternative historical foreign policy paths and shaping the air and naval war. Additionally, players construct a Hearts &amp;amp; Minds (H&amp;amp;M) pool. The H&amp;amp;M pool is supplemented during the turn by wide variety of actions and events (reflecting the vagaries of support for both sides); the more friendly H&amp;amp;M blocks placed into the pool, the greater the chance of gaining dominant control of Spanish provinces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Action Phase, players utilize their respective decks of Action Cards (ACs) to activate units for movement and combat, implement events (receive reinforcements, etc.), conduct a range of political operations, generate replacements or strategically redeploy units. And, in a twist from other games in the Paths of Glory genre, players must plan out their play of ACs in advance: players secretly specify the order of play of their ACs (&amp;quot;the AC stack&amp;quot;) and allocate one AC to &amp;quot;the AC reserve&amp;quot;. Limited air operations occur during the Action Phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Logistics Phase, players addresses attrition, rebuilding units, determining province control and other odds and ends. Province control is a function of controlling Provincial Presence Locations and the Provincial Capital and making a successful Province Allegiance Attempt (H&amp;amp;M blocks have an important effect). One key H&amp;amp;M dynamic is a random draw from the H&amp;amp;M pool, placing those H&amp;amp;M blocks on provinces and a variable ending to the phase; players are not quite sure &amp;ldquo;when the music will end&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The campaign game is playable in about six to eight hours, while a shorter introductory scenario takes between two and four hours. The game is won by controlling key geographical locations (ex: dominant control of provinces and control of urban areas), which generates victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triumph of Fascism is somewhat of a sequel to Triumph of Chaos(ToC). Changes verses ToC include inclusion of: &amp;#10;&amp;bull; A less abstracted air and naval components&amp;#10;&amp;bull; A significant hearts &amp;amp; minds mechanic &amp;#10;&amp;bull; More of an emphasis on the build up to the conflict&amp;#10;&amp;bull; A foreign policy track; allowing for a wider range of outcomes the conflict could take&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both games utilize the Paths of Glory game engine, supplemented by a significant political &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; component, which has its roots in Days of Decision and Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spring 2105&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
