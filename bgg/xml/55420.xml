    <description>Project: Last Hope is a game for up to 12 players, playable in 2-4 hours. The game is set on the world of Aquea, whose inhabitants have suddenly found themselves forcibly bound together in order to save themselves from a terrible new threat that has, by all appearances, emerged from another world to consume theirs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of the players commands a mighty orbiting warship from which they deploy strike teams to the planet's surface in order to repel attacks, secure resources, construct fortifications and &amp;ndash; hopefully &amp;ndash; assist in breaking the siege (even if only temporarily).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will have to strike a balance between acting altruistically to assist their fellow players in repelling the invaders and acting in self-interest so that they not only survive but emerge a major power in the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
