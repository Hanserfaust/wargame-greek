    <description>Bitter Heights: The Battle of Mitla Pass: October 29-31, 1956, is a low-complexity game on the battle for Mitla Pass during the 1956 Arab-Israeli War. The Israelis were to take and hold the Pass to prevent Egyptian forces from reinforcing their counterparts to the east, as well as establish a credible force that could threaten the Suez Canal. This would provide the pretext for Great Britain and France to intervene and take the crucial waterway back from Egyptian control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle would come to represent the confused and tragic aspects of this war. The Israelis underestimated the strength of their opposition, the indecisive actions of their British and French allies upon which this operation depended, and the diplomatic victory Nasser and the Arab Allies would realize despite the military defeats they sustained. General Sharon&amp;rsquo;s controversial decision, to attack and take control of the pass in disobedience of direct orders, led to high losses in a fight that did nothing to further the Israeli cause.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the Israeli player you will have to keep your losses low, while keeping hold of the roadway through the pass, as the Egyptian player you want the Israeli's to pay a high price.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Activation takes place by the use of a deck of cards, similar to the Pocket Battle Games by ATO. This creates the chaos of war that makes play unpredictable and interactive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 3 hours&amp;#10;Area: 1 inch equals 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers&amp;#10;Units: Battalion to Army&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map&amp;#10;One dual-side printed un-mounted countersheet (90 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&amp;#10;One 4-page rulebook&amp;#10;One Player Aid Chart&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player Provided: One 6-sided die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Low&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
