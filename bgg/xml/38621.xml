    <description>&amp;ldquo;The British, under the command of General Cornwallis, were successful in their battles in the southern colonies. Their adversary, General Greene, could not defeat the British but he was determined to deny the British a decisive victory so that his army could remain a potential threat.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The largest engagement took place near Guilford Courthouse in North Carolina. Greene deployed his men in three lines, with the militia in the first two lines. The British drove the Americans from the field but suffered heavy casualties, and Greene was able to withdraw his surviving army before it could be destroyed. The British said of the battle that &amp;lsquo;another such victory would ruin the British Army.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 7.5x5 foot table using 1/72 scale plastic miniatures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules. Also required for play are materials to represent the several patches of forest scattered around the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
