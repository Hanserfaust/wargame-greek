    <name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="Attu &amp; Kiska: Island War Series, Volume III"/>
    <description>(from the company website)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Island War Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II.&amp;#10;The series contains Saipan &amp;amp; Tinian - Vol. I, Guam - Vol. II, and Attu &amp;amp; Kiska - Vol. III.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Island War Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All naval and air forces are abstract - the main focus of each game is ground combat. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &amp;quot;against the odds&amp;quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the  defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game features include - Limited Intelligence - Amphibious Landings - Night Rules - Banzai Attacks&amp;#10;Coastal Defense Units - Beachheads &amp;amp; Replacements - Fortifications - Weather - And More.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
