    <description>Flying Officer Stumpy Prangsworthy&amp;rsquo;s handlebar moustache streamed behind him in the 280mph wind as he craned his head round trying to locate where Von Strudels Focke Wulf 190 A8 had gone to. Deep within the cloud, the spineless Boche had shown his true colours and escaped Stumpys righteous justice. The growling Merlin engine sang a new song as he side-slipped his trusty Supermarine Spitfire down towards the now helpless Dornier 17.&amp;#10; The Dornier was almost at the target and in scant moments would land at the brewery and snatch No14 Squadrons Claret from under their noses. Well Stumpy would see about that. He loosed the safety off of his eight .303&amp;rsquo;s and aimed at the Dorniers port engine.&amp;#10;  Suddenly from behind screaming out of a wingunder manoeuvre the FW 190 appeared in Stumpys vanity mirror, its cannons sparkling motes of fire. A shell smashed into the Spits wing and tore the aileron. &amp;ldquo;Blast you, Von Strudel &amp;ldquo;yelled Stumpy as he realised that he had been sold a duffer and was gone for a burton. Only one trick could save him. Feathering his Kites prop, he hit the airbrakes and was rewarded with the bright green FW 190 flashing under him. Dropping the nose Stumpy let rip a corking burst which caught the Jerry a treat. Flames poured from the FW 190&amp;rsquo;s  engine and Von Strudel Hit the Silk. &amp;#10;Von Strudel shook his fist as Stumpy flashed past. &amp;ldquo;Verdammt Englander! Finish me now! The shame is too great!&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Not a chance old pip,&amp;rdquo; grinned Stumpy; &amp;ldquo;A Englishman flies by the rules of the game, and potting a Chap on his chute is defiantly not playing the game.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;So what is playing the game? You are about to find out!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blazing Skies is a Tactical WW2 Flight combat game. Each player takes control of a WW2 aircraft and battles his/her opponents in fast paced duels to the death. The roar of engines, the rattle of dice , the contrails streaming from wingtips and the chugging down of pints of claret. Its all here in Blazing Skies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;45 full colour pages of rules, background, templates, charts, diagrams and quick reference sheets&amp;#10;Six exciting scenarios and one boring one.&amp;#10;A physics model that simulates the effects of gravity, engine power, high energy manouvers.&amp;#10;A campaign game that rewards skillful pilots&amp;#10;Take offs!&amp;#10;Landings!&amp;#10;Prangings!&amp;#10;Collisions!&amp;#10;Gongs!&amp;#10;Random Events!&amp;#10;A huge list of literally hundreds of WW2 and interwar aircraft.Evrything from the mundane to the mad with more on the way!&amp;#10;Support via email and forums&amp;#10;Clouds&amp;#10;Flack&amp;#10;Bombing&amp;#10;Pilots personal skill&amp;#10;Idiosyncratic Aircraft that behave like their real life counterparts! Except in model form! if its a avro Manchester, it will handle like slop and struggle at altitude, its engines will also overheat!&amp;#10;Updates to new kites and scenarios as and when I get round to doing em.&amp;#10;This is a truely epic set of WW2 rules and is set to become the benchmark for Air Combat games. it is designed for 1/144 or 1/72 scale aircraft and a dogfight is easily playable in 30 mins. Multiplane fights are easily fought to a conclusion in a hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Luftwaffe trained its best pilots in WW2 using these rules.*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are easy to pick up and play and have plenty of examples. in fact, you start off at RAF Debden where the Sq ldr will take you through your first flight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Not actually true&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dust off your old airfix kits or FOW 1/144 planes and put in an order to Topgunmarketing for some flightstands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chocks Away!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
